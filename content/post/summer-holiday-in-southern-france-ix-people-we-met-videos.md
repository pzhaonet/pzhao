> On the night of Day 10, we arrived home in Innsbruck. It was cold, we saw people wearing winter clothes. The holiday in Southern France was like a warm dream. The sceneries were fantastic, but those kind people we met were more unforgettable.


假期第十天的晚上，我们回到了因斯布鲁克的家里。下飞机的时候，看到有人居然穿着羽绒服，冷得能看得见哈气。相比之下，南法的假日变得如此不真实，就像一场温暖的梦。旅游的景色当然是美妙的，然而，我们遇见的那些人更难以忘怀。

> Frankly speaking, I was worried about this trip at the beginning, mostly because of those terrorism attacks in France, especially in Nice. But my wife was quite optimistic. 'People care more about the security after the attacks', she said. Yes, we did see armed policemen or soldiers walking slowly in the streets in every French city.


老实说，度假前我比较担心，主要是源于发生在法国的几次恐怖袭击，尤其是发生在我们的旅行目的地之一尼斯。不过，我媳妇对此比较乐观。“发生之后会更安全。”确实如此，我们在每个城市都看见武警或士兵在街上巡逻。

> When we sat on a square near the Old Port of Marseille,  an old man came to us and ask where we were from. He spoke only a little English. When he heard that we were from China, he said, 'China, good country, good people.' Then he left. Some minutes later, he came back with two icecreams for my kids! The kids loved him so much!


在马赛老港口旁边的一个广场上，我们坐下来休息，这时走过来一位老人，用蹩脚的英文问我们从哪里来。当得知我们来自中国时，他说：“中国，好国，好人！”然后就离开了。几分钟后，他回来了，带着两个冰淇淋，送给我的孩子。两个孩子爱死他了。


> The other day we wanted to take Bus 19 to a beach in Marseille. We found the bus stop and waited. Two old women sitting there, watching us for a while, came to me and asked something in France. I understood nothing. They looked so worried, and one of them suddenly said, in English, 'nineteen, no. twenty-one, yes.' I still did not get it. They went to a girl who was standing not faraway and talked to her. The girl smiled and came and explained in English that there was no Bus 19 at this bus stop at lunch time now and we had to take Bus 21 to another stop and there was Bus 19 available. Although 19 and 21 were the only thing they could express in English, they still tried hard to let me know.

在马赛的那一天，我们打算乘坐19路公交车去沙滩。我们在公交车站等车的时候，两个老太太坐在那里，打量了我们一会儿，走过来，对我说了一堆法语。我当然一个字都没听懂。他们看起来很焦急，其中一位突然开口说英语：“19，不。21，是。”我还是没懂。他们就走向不远处站着的一个女孩，交谈了几句，那女孩就笑着过来用英文解释：这会儿已经是中午，19路公交车在本站不停，必须乘坐21路车到另一站才能换19路。老太太绞尽脑汁用尽了他们会说的英语，努力让我知道这个重要信息。


> Luckily this girl was going to the beach as well. She said we could follow her to get on Bus 21 and change to Bus 19.  So we talked on the way. She lived somewhere else (I did not remember the name of the city) in France and was having a holiday in Marseille as well as we were. She suggested that I could install an app called RTM on my smartphone so that I could see the real-time info of the public transportation. When we got to the destination, she guided us to the beach. She knew everything in Marseille!


恰好这个女孩也去沙滩，她说我们可以跟她一起走。一路上我们聊了聊。她住在法国的另一座城市（我没记住名字），跟我们一样来马赛度假。她建议我在手机里安装个名叫 RTM 的软件，可以实时查询马赛的公交信息。达到目的地后，她指给我们如何去我们要去的沙滩。看起来她对马赛了如指掌。


> Yes, Marseille was my most favorite city in this trip. Marseille, the second largest city in France after Paris, looks like Guangzhou in China. I wish I could visit there again some day.

这次度假，我们游览了尼斯、摩洛哥、戛纳、马赛、阿维尼翁等城市。毫无疑问，马赛最让我喜爱。马赛是法国第二大城市，仅次于巴黎。给我的感觉，就像中国的广州。希望将来有一天再度旅游南法，拜访马赛，看更多的风景，遇见更多的人。


>  However, the greatest happiness was still the moment when we got home. Nothing is more beautiful than the lamp in your house when you are back home at night.


不过，我们最大的快乐，仍然是回到家里的那一刻。走遍千山万水，世间风景再美，都不及归人看到家里的一盏灯火。
