The candidate should have a first class or upper second class honours degree, or a master’s degree (or equivalent qualification), in Environmental Science. Evidence of good spoken and written English is essential. The candidate should have an IELTS score of 6.5 or above, if the first language is not English. This position is open to all qualified candidates irrespective of nationality.

## Degree

The student will be awarded a PhD degree from the University of Liverpool (UK) upon successful completion of the program.

## Project Description

### PGRS2021 (Open)

Bioaerosols comprise of viruses, bacteria and bacteria agglomerates, fungal and plant spores, and pollen, which widely exist in the atmosphere and have key effects on genetic transport, human health, and climate. However, the knowledge on the transport processes of bioaerosols, especially the vertical exchange of bioaerosols and the factors controlling their atmospheric transport based on observations is very limited due to the lack of advanced measurement techniques. This study will develop and apply a novel direct measurement system by integrating the state-of-the-art micrometeorological technique with the newly developed online bioaerosol sensor, supported by a modern data processing package. Field campaigns will be carried out and provide valuable information on bioaerosol exchange and interaction between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, which is required to validate and parameterize related global and regional models.
